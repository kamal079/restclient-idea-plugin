This project converts the popular RESTClient application from [WizTools](http://www.wiztools.org) into an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that supports all of its features. These features include support for all HTTP methods, saving requests and responses, custom headers, basic and digest authentication, proxy servers, SSL, request/response tracing, test scripts, and Base64 password encoding/decoding.

To install, download the plugin file, unzip it into your IntelliJ IDEA "plugins" folder, and restart IDEA. Launch the RESTClient plugin by clicking its name/icon at the bottom of the IDEA window (see screenshot below).
